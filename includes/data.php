    8 => "If you consider the average developer, constrained by time and having bills to pay...often just needs to get the job done to complete a contract or not get fired. Therefore, when choosing whether to create something from scratch to solve a problem that's already been solved in the past, it almost never makes sense to do so. They will just go grab some framework or tool, even if they barely understand how it works for the sake of the result. It's completely rational. But how do you quantify the situations where the deep-learning sacrificed with this approach could have far reaching but more subtle effects in the future of said developer's path?</p><p>I think the answer is that it is quite difficult to do so. Also difficult is going against conventional wisdom. But that's what I'm arguing for here. I'm about 6 months into my C++ game engine project if you include some of the learn-up beforehand to get some minimum understanding of C++ desktop-app development and Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL version 2.0). I'm way behind where I would have though six months of progress would land me, but I'm having so much fun. From researching the formula for gravity and learning how to implement that relative to my character's height in pixels and the speed at which my game loop was cycling to FINALLY using some of that high-school math for collision that we have memes for how useless it is in real life...I'm having some of the most victorious moments in my life as a developer. And some really cool subtle learning experiences too. Like stumbling into the same quirk I noticed in Super Meat Boy's physics--where quickly reversing horizontal direction on the analog stick resulted in a slippery run, but releasing the joystick to neutral results in an immediate stop...and correcting this (hint: if you skip over the deadzone of the joystick without your game noticing, you likely also skip a line of code setting yVelocity=0, which means your horizontal velocity modifier takes longer to wind down the velocity in the other direction to zero, resulting in the Mario-on-ice effect. You can do this intentionally, but I would argue for either always having slippery slow-down or don't at all).</p><p>Some other learning experiences that I'm looking forward to are the refactoring to use more modern C++ techniques, optimizing to use less memory and CPU power, and implementing proper error-handling. I think this will result in some of my most consequential personal-growth as a developer. An additional benefit of all this masochism is that I actually have something genuinely exciting to talk about in an interview or networking conversation. I don't know about you, but trying to church up some crud CRUD app I made in my boot camp during a job interview is absolute misery. I'm finally becoming the developer I originally set out to be with this career change. One with confidence, passion-for-learning and definitely NOT an imposter.</p><p>Good luck with your decision and I hope this was helpful in some way. Feel free to follow my game engine progress and on YouTube or GitHub.",

    8 => "I'm not young anymore. I'm not old either. I'm in that fairly large middle part of the Venn diagram, assuming I have enough genetic good luck. And on an average day I feel really good. Not just in a “my back feels good and I got enough sleep last night” way, but more the feeling that I'm where I should be and I'm focused on the things that my future self will be proud of. It's a deeper state of feeling that isn't really connected to the day to day frustrations and triumphs of my normal life. It's that underlying current that determines my long term outlook and how those day to day frustrations will affect me long term. This is a big deal for me, too, because I've spent large chunks of time, sometimes consecutive years at a time just generally out of sorts.</p><p>You may relate to the situation I was in before—disconnected, unfocused, bouncing between careers or ideas for what your life should be versus what it is. Only to realize a short time later that your target was completely wrong and so you restart the cycle. These cycles become very costly, too. There are large opportunity costs of not planting your feet and working toward a long term goal for your life. These manifest financially and socially as well. Financially, as you can't build wealth always being an entry level practitioner of some skill or position, wasting money moving around, and socially because friendship has a way of becoming scarce as you get older. Old relationships suffer if you don't put in the time, newer relationships get abandoned when you uproot, and future relationships are simply harder to come by due to some invisible law.</p><p>Depression and self-loathing always seem to thrive during the times where I am most unsure about what I am doing with my life. This is a predictable outcome if you give it some thought. We seem to have evolved to have a role in our broader community, to have people depend on us and to see that our efforts and skills are valued. Even if you straight up don't give a crap what people think and generally like being alone, I think you at least want to know that your job matters, there is some point to what you are learning ,or that a something you created is valued by a group of people, even if they're hard to find. For quite some time I had convinced myself that I didn't really need a defined purpose to be happy. Considering how random and fleeting our existence is in this life, it didn't seem prudent to attach rules or structure to my life where I didn't feel required to.</p><p>As a result, I've spent years wandering. I've travelled, repeatedly. I've moved more times that I can count. I've been enrolled in five degree programs and still don't have a degree to show for it. I've lived in a vehicle, twice, bought a house to only move out of it 8 months later and quit countless jobs before I gave them a good chance. I've even been in the military, twice. I don't really have a problem with the idea of a dynamic life, but for the most part, there were no good reasons for most of the big changes in my past. I just did things on a whim. Usually as soon as I stopped being challenged or I detected some dissonance between my expectations and reality, I would discard an entire life path. Because I don't have a family depending on me, there was no external pressure to stop uprooting. It was absolutely exhausting and I can still feel a lingering tiredness in my soul from it all.</p><p>Eventually the absurdity of it all just became apparent. I knew something had shifted when I started to become envious of the things people had accomplished with their boring, conservative, linear lives. What probably stung the most about this shift is how far behind it made me feel. And how alone. I have plenty of loving people in my life, even if I don't give them the time that I should. They've always been there for me when I needed them, and I know a lot of people can't say the same for themselves. But in this case, support or encouragement didn't help with the realization that I've wasted over a decade of my life when I probably knew better, but chose not to listen. This was my own doing and it was up to me to fix it.</p><p>But the title of the article is about feeling good, what's all this depressing stuff?! Well, that's pretty much where the bummer ends. There wasn't any internal deliberation about what to do next because I knew a shift had already taken place in who I was and what I would do. I would pick up and finish off what I started in the past. I wouldn't go down any path I wasn't absolutely determined to finish. I would stop running, escaping, quitting, all of it. And most of all, I would set goals that were truly difficult and believe in myself enough to finish them. I would also forgive myself. That was probably the hardest part. Because my past self had been lazy, wasteful and unfocused, it just seems justified to be so angry with that person. I've just decided to channel that anger into motivation for doing better. I know I can't make up completely for the lost time, but I can do my best to try.</p><p>I wish I could distill my experience into some easy three-step plan to climb out of a similar situation. Or how to reach out to a loved one who won't stop repeatedly changing plans, uprooting and making their life more difficult than it has to be. I waited a long time before writing this to make sure I wasn't just on one of my periodical highs in yet another cycle before writing this. Something is definitely different now. I feel a clarity and focus that I've never known before. Now I'm left wondering if I made it here through some internal struggle via my own willpower or just experienced a shift in brain chemistry from getting older that resulted in a behavioral change. I'll admit, it's not the most satisfying ending. Maybe this is just the way it goes sometimes. I can't possibly be alone in my experience given how many like-minded souls I've met on my travels. And so it goes.</p><p>That brings us to the present. I'm back in school to finish my four-year degree even though I feel way too old to be here. I'm finally going to finish this thing, and I'm going to do well enough that the doors of grad school are open for should I choose to go that route. Once I finish, I'm going to apply for jobs beyond my experience and education, be willing to fight the long fight in the job market instead of taking the first thing that comes along or start my own business. In my free time I'm pursuing additional learning in areas that are interesting enough to be relaxing but can further my career. I'm carefully picking up new hobbies that will provide endless challenge, yet be highly rewarding. I'm not running away anymore. I'm here, living in the present. I will not accept mediocrity in my life and I will not quit.",

    8 => "Hop over to YouTube for a demo of the game in action: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5YyUSyPGuc\">Link</a> <br><br>So the first thing you'll notice about my game is that it looks like it was made 2 decades ago. It's really simple, there isn't all that much going on...and it's pretty short. How is it possible that this is all that I was able to accomplish over the months? Well first off, I'm in school full time so I really wasn't able to dedicate that much time to it. Second, I actually didn't seek any outside solutions for any system in the game beyond the SDL functionality for drawing the window, sound, using the Rectangle class for measuring collision overlap, getting the gamepad input, timestamps, and creating textures. Not that those systems are trivial. On the contrary, I would have never gotten a square to move on the screen if I didn't have that stuff to rely on. </p><p>But I did sink a lot of time on some basic things like collision correction and the physics. Especially	the physics. Since I didn't have any exposure to physics coursework at the time (I took dummy classes in high school because I was lazy...but I am currently in a physics class so I'm slowly getting there), I just hacked my way through gravity, gaining a pretty good understanding of calculating velocity changes in between cycles and how to apply gravity in an appropriate way. I had heard of the use of a heavier gravity from the older Mario games, so I was able to figure that out fairly easily too. However, I neglected to assign any sort of mass/momentum in my calculations. This had some repercussions later on. </p><p>I originally wanted this to be a Contra-style, side-scroller shooter but much faster paced and with heavy blowback physics for the weapons. Essentially your weapons would be used to take out enemies but also to propel you in a helpful way through unique obstacles, like a pogo or jetpack effect. Because I did not keep track of any mass of the player, I was not able to systematically figure out how much to push my player back given how strong the explosive collision forces should be for each weapon/projectile. As a result, I attempted to come up with arbitrary velocities to add to my player for each weapon but it was always just plain wrong and had side effects depending how near in time a jump was. It quickly became apparent that the path I was headed down wasn't going to work so I scrapped the shooter portion. </p><p>I also made a big mistake not separating my physics updates from my drawing of each frame. What this means is that as I was fine-tuning the physics to work well with my high refresh rate of 165Hz, when I attempted to bump up my frame skipping value in milliseconds to draw at 60fps, the physics approximations were different resulting in different jump heights and velocities from gravity (even though I was applying gravity scaled to how many milliseconds had passed, the resulting velocity changes each frame compounded and created a noticeably different result). Furthermore, when it came time to utilize SDL v-sync to fix the very noticeable shearing with all the repeating tile patterns, that had the effect of simply slowing the engine down when I was hooked up to a slower monitor. I'm guessing it blocked at my calls to draw what the renderer had in between what it knew were the cycle rates of the video output my system was using. I was hoping to get lucky and just have it throw away the extra calls to draw, effectively keeping my physics seamless between refresh rates. Maybe there is some simple solution to resolve the cycling issue, but combined with other issues in my physics, it was clear to me that it just needed to be redone from the ground up. </p><p>Going back to collision, I was able to rely on the SDL Rectangle class to do a lot of the heavy lifting. It was pretty simple to do, keeping my player's previous position saved as a Rectangle object, checking the current position collision with a temporary Rectangle object that I would assign the position of each tile I was checking. Then I would just move my player back toward its previous position by an amount of the collision width and height. This worked out pretty well, but wasn't really in depth enough for the lethal tile checking I would need later on. Specifically, I had issues that I won't dive into too deeply regarding the player landing on a non-lethal tile next to a lethal tile and hitting its head on a similar type of setup. I had included lethality checking as part of the collision checks, and this resulted in the player losing a life when it should have been able to just be considered to be on top of the non-lethal tile. Obviously I was missing some additional logic for lethality and it needed to be a part of a different logic set outside of collision correction. More OOP! </p><p>Finally, the biggest thing that got in the way toward the end after accepting the limitations that could only be fixed by scrapping and restarting was that I didn't have a good way for tiles to essentially interact with each other. I had figured out consumables with my tile objects having a tile id they could transform into after consumption, but I had no way for this process to work in reverse, which would be necessary for a collection of tiles to move across the screen (moving platform, Mario style bullets, disappearing and reappearing tiles, etc). When I really took a look into resolving this, it basically again meant scrapping my system and starting over. I think you're probably getting the point now that the lack of initial design time was bringing this thing to its end. Given what systems I did have, I didn't think I had enough variation to really make this fun. Aside from ice blocks and quicksand, there wasn't much left to add. </p><p>So here we are. I learned a ton. I got to solve little individual problems which is super fun for me, and probably why I stuck with it as long as I did. But I need to be realistic about managing my time to get the most impactful results and this was essentially a time suck. I think I could have done better learning Unity or Unreal, or just focusing at getting better at web stacks. I have been neglecting launching my other domain, jrose.us, which is meant to be more of a complex resource hub versus this simplistic blog and also a better showcasing of my developer skills (art assets, sounds, desktop app and web templates, etc). Also, I haven't yet finished the website for my new LLC, Summit Data Solutions. IMO, These have the potential to be much more impactful than the masochistic pursuit of building games from scratch so it's time to shift my priorities. Oh yeah, and I need to not flunk my classes. And I need to run more. And play with my dog. Also, I am trying to learn sound design and music composition. God I wish I had more time.",
